NAME
    CatalystX::ActionBuilders - A DSL for declaring controller paths

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.003 of CatalystX::ActionBuilders -
    released April 25, 2014 as part of CatalystX-ActionBuilders.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
        use CatalystX::ActionBuilders;

        extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

        # aka: sub index : Path(q{}) Args(0) { ... }
        index_action { ... do something indexy here ... };

        public list
            => args 1
            => template 'other_list.tt2'
            => sub {
                my ($self, $c) = @_;

                ... something listy here ...
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This package exports sugar that allows paths to be declared without
    having to hew to any of the requirements of attributes. Note that this
    is an _alternate_ way to declare paths; you can still use the standard
    approach without fear or reprisal.

    We provide common shortcuts to common "special" actions (index, default,
    etc) as well as some helpers for commonly-used packages.

BEWARE!
    This is a pretty early version based off of 2-ish year old code, and
    needs a goodly number of (any!) tests. YMMV, pull-requests welcome. Some
    stuff may disappear, some stuff may appear, etc, etc.

SPECIAL ACTIONS
    These all take one argument, a coderef; e.g.

        index_action { ... do something indexy ... };

  index_action
  default_action
  begin_action
  end_action
  auto_action
ACTIONS
  public
  private
  global
ACTION PARAMETERS
    Probably not the best name for this.

NAVIGATION/MENU PARAMETERS
    We also include support for defining menu attributes that can be used by
    Catalyst::Plugin::Navigation.

BEGIN BLOCKS
    It's good practice to wrap any "extends" in your controller classes --
    essential if you're using the standard approach of method attributes to
    define your routes.

    If you're using this package exclusively to define actions, you do not
    need to use a BEGIN block. Note I'm not recommending this, just stating
    that it's possible -- and if something breaks, you get to keep all the
    pieces :)

    *   This package is largely inspired by (and steals parts of)
        CatalystX::Routes.
